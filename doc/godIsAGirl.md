Remembering me,

Discover and see

All over the world,

She's known as a girl

To those who are free,

The mind shall be key

Forgotten as the past

'Cause history will last

God is a girl,

Wherever you are,

Do you believe it, can you receive it?

God is a girl,

Whatever you say,

Do you believe it, can you receive it?

God is a girl,

However you live,

Do you believe it, can you receive it?

God is a girl,

She's only a girl,

Do you believe it, can you receive it?

She wants to shine,

Forever in time,

She is so driven, she's always mine

Cleanly and free,

She wants you to be

A part of the future,

A girl like me

There is a sky,

illuminating us, someone is out there

That we truly trust

There is a rainbow for you and me

A beautiful sunrise eternally

God is a girl

Wherever you are,

Do you believe it, can you receive it?

God is a girl

Whatever you say,

Do you believe it, can you receive it?

God is a girl

However you live,

Do you believe it, can you receive it?

God is a girl

She's only a girl,

Do you believe it, can you receive it?

God is a girl

Wherever you are,

Do you believe it, can you receive it?

God is a girl

Whatever you say,

Do you believe it, can you receive it?

God is a girl

However you live,

Do you believe it, can you receive it?

God is a girl

She's only a girl,

Do you believe it, can you receive it?

God is a girl
